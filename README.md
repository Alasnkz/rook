# rook

An experimental parser for the Pawn language.

Nothing super interesting yet, come back later.

Some rough goals:

- Lexing/tokenisation
- Build AST
- Static analysis over AST
- Formatter

Probably never going to happen but nice to think about:

- Actual pcode compiler implementation
- Preprocessor
